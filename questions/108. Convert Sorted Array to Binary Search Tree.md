## Keys
1. The rootIndex:
    - When the length between start and end is odd number:  
        ```rootIndex = start + (end - start) / 2```
    - When the length between start and end is even number:  
        ```rootIndex = start + (end - start) / 2 + 1```
 2. Height balanced BST:  
 A node in a tree is height-balanced if the heights of its subtrees differ by no more than 1.
