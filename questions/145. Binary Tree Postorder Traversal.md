## Questions: 
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/

## Keys
1. Binary Search Tree(BST): 
    - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
2. The following type is not a valid BST:

3. Order for traverse: left --> right --> root
4. ```ArrayList``` has a method:
    ```
    public void add(int index, E element)
    ``` 
    Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list. Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent elements to the right (adds one to their indices).


## Corner Cases:

## Solutions:
1. Recursion: with the help of helper func:
    ```
    
    ```
2. Iteration: with the help of Stack:
    ```
    while(!st.isEmpty()) {
        cur = st.pop();
        res.add(0, cur.val);
        if(cur.left != null) st.push(cur.left);
        if(cur.right != null) st.push(cur.right);
    }
    ```
