## Keys

## Corner Cases:
head and tail

## Solutions:
1. Iteration/Recursion  
Compare with 108, the difference is how to find the middle of a given length Array/LinkedList  
    - Array  
      ```(end-start) % 2 == 0 ? (start + (end-start) / 2) : (start + (end-start) / 2 + 1);```
    - LinkedList: two pointers: fast and slow
      ```
      while(fast != tail && fast.next != tail) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
      }
