https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/

## Keys
1. Binary Search Tree(BST): 
    - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
2. The following type is not a valid BST:

3. Order for traverse: left --> root --> right

## Corner Cases:

## Solutions:
1. Recursion: with the help of helper func:
    ```
    private void helper(List<Integer> res, TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return;
        helper(res, root.left);
        res.add(root.val);
        helper(res, root.right);
    }
    ```
2. Iteration: with the help of Stack:
    ```

    ```
